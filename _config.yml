title_description: "I'm currently working as Software Development Engineer - II (Backend) in one of the product offering teams at MindTickle. Before that, I worked as a full-stack engineer at Societe Generale, Bengaluru (SocGen) primarily in the domain of Blockchain and AR/VR for internally incubated startups and different business lines within the group.
<br/><br/>
As far as my educational qualification is concerned, I've completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.
I'm a self-taught software engineer who just started by googling - <i>\"how to make a website\"</i>, and got esctatic as the color of the text on the screen changed on doing what was instructed. After that I explored and undertook projects in Web Development, Machine Learning and Blockchain - all in chronological order.
<br/><br/>
You can find me either binge-watching shows, listening to pop and progressive rock music, or surfing the tidal waves of the internet - primarily Reddit or HackerNews."
